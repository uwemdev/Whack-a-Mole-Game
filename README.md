About Whack a Mole Game

This project aims to recreate the classic Whack a Mole game using basic web technologies without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The game involves a grid of holes where "moles" randomly pop up, and the player's objective is to click on them as quickly as possible before they disappear. The player earns points for each successful whack and loses points for clicking on empty holes. The HTML markup defines the structure of the game interface, including the grid layout for the holes and any additional elements such as score counters or timer displays. CSS is used for styling the game elements, including visual effects for the moles popping up and disappearing.

JavaScript (VanillaJS) handles the game logic, including randomly selecting holes for the moles to appear, tracking player input (clicks), updating the score, and managing game timing. Event listeners are used to detect player clicks on the moles and trigger appropriate actions.
